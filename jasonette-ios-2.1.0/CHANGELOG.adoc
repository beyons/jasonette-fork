## 2.1.0

This version have minor fixes and updates.

### Added

- Ability to use mixin with _POST_ requests. Example:

```json
{"@": "https://example.com[POST]"}
``` 
Would fetch the url using _POST_ instead of _GET_ (Useful for _Bubble_ or similar systems).

- Ability to show ATTracking alert in iOS >= 14.5:
Set `tracking_enabled` to true inside _settings.plist_.

### Changed

- Bumped to minimum iOS version `12.0`.

### Fixed

- Crash when passing `href` with a non object.
- Crash in iOS 14.
- Push notifications were using code that was non deterministic to obtain the token. Now the token is parsed correctly.
- Random Crashes due to updating the UI in a background thread.
- Removed deprecation warnings when using `[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:]`.
- Problems when using Tabbars.

### Updated

- Updated to `AFNetworking` 4.0.1 (was 3.2.1).
- Updated to `FLEX` 4.1.1 (was 3.0.0).
- Updated to `SocketRocket` 0.5.2 (was 0.5.1).

## https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonelle/releases/tag/v2.0[2.0.0]

This version was released in November 2019.

### Added

- New Logger for Native Code. Makes easier to Spot Errors. See xcode/Jasonette/Logger/README.md[xcode/Jasonette/Logger/README.md] For more details.

- Added `JasonNetworking.h` to enable configuring `AFHTTPSessionManager` and `AFJSONResponseSerializer`.

- Docs on how to implement extensions.

- Added http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net/[`uncrustify`] config for code style standarization.

- Added new option in `href` to load a `web` with `reader mode`.
  Based on the code by `@seletz`.

```json
{
  "options": {
    "reader": true
  }
}
```

- Added `$orientation` system event
  that triggers when the orientation changes.

- Added `$env.view.params` variable that holds the query params inside the url.
  Example `https://example.com?param1=1&params2=true`. Will show `param1` and `param2` as properties inside the params dictionary. (Only for for internet addresses. _file://_ does not work.)

- Added `$agent.logger` to `agent.js` that can call the system logger.
  Methods: `$agent.logger.log`, `$agent.logger.debug`, `$agent.logger.info`, `$agent.logger.warn`, `$agent.logger.error`. As replacements of `console.log` methods for webviews.

- Added optional `nonce` to url in `settings.plist`. Now is easier to invalidate server cache if needed.

### Changed

- Bumped to minimum iOS version `9.0`.

- Improved `JasonComponentFactory.h` to take in consideration `Swift` extensions.

- Establish `AppDelegate.h` as main _App Delegate_ instead of `JasonAppDelegate.h`. The later will serve as a wrapper.

- Improved Code Organization.

- Improved Networking Code.

### Fixed

- Fixed Crash on parsing local json files with wrong syntax.

- Fixed Crash when no `$jason` property is present in json.

- Fixed Crash when url contained html content in a json expected return.

- Fixed Blank Screen when no `url` is found in `settings.plist`.

- Fixed Blank Screen if you click a `Tab Item` more than once.

- Fixed `WKWebView` orientation change not working. Based on the code by `@ricardojlpinto`.

- Fixed Crash when using`$vision` on simulator.

- Fixed not finding class when using non standard naming in extensions (now searches in lowercase too).

- Fixed Crash in iOS 10 when using webcontainers. It crashed because before iOS 11 the observers to notifications does not autorelease. Solved using `INTUAutoRemoveObserver`.

- Fixed Random Crash. The property `styles` in `JasonViewController` was not initialized
  in some use cases. Now is lazy allocated
  to prevent random crashes.

- Fixed Crash when using iOS 13.
